# Runtime dependency inventory

Audit snapshot: 2026-08-15 on Windows/Python 3.14. Direct version ranges are
declared in `pyproject.toml`; resolved versions below are what those ranges
resolve to on that platform.
All are runtime dependencies. None is bundled in the source distribution or
wheel. Frozen-executable bundling remains deferred behind the focused LGPL
review.
