# Sovereign Core public API (`0.x`)

This document defines the supported Python import surface for application and
channel authors. Before `1.0`, breaking changes remain possible and increment
the owning version; compatibility is never inferred from package version alone.

## Core application API

The names exported by `sovereign.__all__` are public. Applications should import
these contracts from `sovereign`, not from host, controller, transport, relay,
or persistence modules. All other Python modules and names are implementation
details unless this document explicitly says otherwise.

The current exports are: `ApplicationFacade`, `ApplicationFacadeLookup`,
`ApplicationInstance`, `ApplicationManifest`, `ApplicationRegistration`,
`ApplicationResultView`, `ApplicationServices`, `ApplicationSpec`,
`BlobChannel`, `Channel`, `ChannelAcceptance`, `ChannelResult`,
`IncompatibleApplicationFacade`, `Invitation`, `LastWriteWinsPolicy`, `LivenessChannel`,
`ManagedChannel`, `PairingChannel`, `PerspectiveObservation`,
`PerspectiveSource`, `ProjectedNode`, `PollCycleResult`,
`PollingChannel`, `PollingEndpoint`, `ProtocolNode`, `ProtocolResult`,
`ProtocolState`, `RelayStorage`, `Session`, `SessionEffect`, `SessionResult`,
`UnsupportedProtocolVersion`, `application_json_response`,
`application_result_view`, `avatar_attachment`, `canonical_attachments`,
`desktop_main`, `json_value`,
`protocol_node_from_envelope`, `protocol_tree_envelope`, and `run_desktop`.

An application module exports:

- `APPLICATION_MANIFEST: ApplicationManifest`
- `create_application(services: ApplicationServices) -> ApplicationInstance`

Applications may register shared topic roots through `ApplicationRegistration`.
They return domain mutations as `SessionResult`. A `SessionEffect` is a
lifecycle signal Core carries out - today only the release of a topic's
channels when its sharing ends - and never a message to a peer: a channel
publishes and polls on its own schedule, not on a caller's.

`ApplicationServices` deliberately exposes no channel manager. Applications
receive a read-only collaboration view and an effect-delivery callable; channel
configuration and the channel inventory are Core-only.

The collaboration view names **topics, never channels**. Besides composing and
accepting a topic invitation it can put one topic where another already is —
`bridge_topic_like(topic, like_topic)` — consent to receive one that is already
there, `follow_bridged_topic(topic, like_topic)`, stop both with
`unbridge_topic(topic)`, and ask `topics_share_a_bridge(topic, like_topic)`.
Applications create topics that belong to other topics — an election belongs to
the team that called it, a board to the team that keeps it — and those have to
travel the same way as the thing they belong to or they reach nobody. Which
channel that is, what it costs and who else is on it stay Core's.

Publishing and receiving stay **two acts**, as they are everywhere else in
Core (`shared` and `desired`). Bridging a topic is the publisher saying where
it goes; following one is the receiver consenting to have it. Merging them
would let one client graft topics into another's tree because the two happen to
share a relay root, which is exactly what the consent gate exists to prevent.
Its `snapshot_response(builder)` binds an application view to one confirmed
Session revision. `composite_response(snapshot_builder, observer, merger)`
extends that contract for views decorated with live transport information:
Session state is snapshotted first, observation and detached merging happen
after its lock is released. `mutation_response(operation, mutation_id=...,
invalidates=...)`
commits a retry-safe human intention; applications pass an unevaluated callback
so mutation, persistence, and revision confirmation share one boundary.

## Attachments

Core owns blob storage, transfer and collection; applications own what an
attachment *means*. `canonical_attachments` validates and normalizes a list of
attachment references, and `avatar_attachment` selects the `avatar` role from
one. Any node whose `data["attachments"]` holds canonical references is found by
Core's publication, peer-fetch and garbage-collection walkers, so an application
adds a new kind of attachment - a card's file, a document's exhibit - without
any Core change. Bytes are uploaded to Core's `/api/blob` endpoint, which owns
the size limit and content addressing; only the reference reaches the
application.

## Desktop window

Serving a host into its own window is Core's work, not an application's: it
owns the runtime, the server and the shutdown. `run_desktop` starts the host
on loopback and shows the window until it is closed; `desktop_main` wraps it
as a command line. An application supplies only what is its own - which module
to start and what to title the window - and declares the `pywebview`
dependency itself, so a headless install stays headless.

Because the port is chosen at start-up, the session file is not derived from
it and is not placed under the working directory. It goes to a per-user
application directory, so state survives a different port or launch location.
An explicit `storage_file` still wins.

## Optional application facades

Cross-application dependencies are optional and late-bound. A producer may put
one `ApplicationFacade` on its `ApplicationInstance`. Its
`facade_api_version` is owned by that producer and is independent from its data
schema and distribution versions.

A consumer calls `services.facades.find(application_id, expected_version)` at
use time. The result is:

- the producer's public API object when active and version-compatible;
- `None` when the producer is inactive;
- `IncompatibleApplicationFacade` when the producer is active with another API
  version.

Consumers must remain usable when an optional producer is absent. They must not
import the producer's logic, controller, or persistence modules. In `0.x`, a
producer exposes at most one facade version at a time; compatibility adapters
belong on the consumer side.

S-Initiative's current facade is `s_initiative.InitiativeFacade`, API version `1`. It
exposes detached query snapshots plus explicit board, card, agenda, reaction,
and policy commands. S-Cockpit consumes it without declaring S-Initiative
as a package dependency.

## Channel extension API

`Channel` is the required extension contract. A channel opts into independent
capabilities by also satisfying:

- `ManagedChannel`: named instance configuration, topic bindings, and
  instance-scoped detach;
- `LivenessChannel`: routed peer reachability;
- `BlobChannel`: remote blob reads through an explicit peer/topic route;
- `PairingChannel`: sibling-client pairing and conflict resolution;
- `PollingChannel`: discovery of independently scheduled `PollingEndpoint`
  objects.

A `PollingEndpoint` provides `poll_interval_seconds`,
`has_active_relationship()`, `polling_diagnostics()`, and one complete
`poll_once(after_apply)` operation. The endpoint owns transport ordering,
timing calibration, response publication, failure handling, and diagnostic
tracing. It calls `after_apply` after applying remote state and before
publishing its response. `poll_once` returns `PollCycleResult`; Core schedules
the endpoint and advances the fixed cadence but does not inspect transport
implementation fields. Standard diagnostic keys are `identity`, `backend`,
`state_file`, and `poll_interval_seconds`; extensions may add keys.

Core owns registration, descriptor negotiation, invitation composition, and
poll scheduling. Concrete mailbox, relay-manager, storage backend, Starlette
controller, and server modules are Core implementation details in `0.x`.
`RelayStorage` is the backend contract used by polling endpoints; it includes
explicit connection closure.

## Protocol and session API

`ProtocolNode`, `ProtocolState`, their envelope helpers, `Session`,
`SessionResult`, and `SessionEffect` are public. The hash and wire semantics are
normative in `SPECIFICATION_S_PROTOCOL.md`; direct mutation of internal indexes,
peer caches, locks, or application registries is unsupported.
Session peer/topic properties are detached snapshots. Applications store local
state only through `application_metadata(application_id)`, which returns the
live namespace and requires the caller to hold `Session.lock`. Core's response
helpers (`mutation_response`, `snapshot_response`, `composite_response`) hold it
already; an application calling from anywhere else opens its own transaction
with `with session.lock:`. See `DESIGN_LOCKING_AND_COMPOSITE_READS.md`.

`Session.project_nodes()` derives a read-only view across local and explicitly
connected peer perspectives without adopting their records. `ProjectedNode`
preserves the detached `ProtocolNode` and adds a verified `PerspectiveSource`;
`PerspectiveObservation` contains runtime-only timing facts. Callers may supply
a relative maximum age, an absolute lower timestamp, both, or neither. Core
measures and filters these facts but does not define domain-level freshness.

`LastWriteWinsPolicy` lets an application declare a narrowly scoped timestamp
rule for one node type. The declaration names the timestamp field and the data
and parent fields that constitute the reconciled value. Passing declarations
to `Session.reconcile_peer_changes(..., reconciliation_policies=...)` makes
Core reject stale candidates, resolve a newer eligible candidate, and normalize
timestamp-only differences. Other field differences remain ordinary
transitions; applications still decide which semantic changes may be adopted.
