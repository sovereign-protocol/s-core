File-mailbox relay sync.

Functionality:
  Store-and-forward sync for peers who are never online at the same time,
  and/or not directly reachable (no inbound NAT traversal needed). Each peer
  identity publishes its current view of every registered application topic into a shared
  storage location (see relay_storage.py - a local folder or a remote SFTP
  server, selected via config), and periodically polls every other known
  identity's published view, applying whatever changed through the
  *existing* sovereign-perspective reconciliation machinery.

  Storage backend selection (config["relay_backend"], default "local"):
    "local" - config["relay_root"] (local folder path).
    "sftp"  - config["relay_sftp_host"] (required to activate), plus
      relay_sftp_port (default 22), relay_sftp_username, relay_sftp_root
      (remote path, default "/"), and either relay_sftp_password or
      relay_sftp_private_key_path (+ optional
      relay_sftp_private_key_passphrase). UI-created SFTP targets persist
      their password in the local session envelope; environment-variable
      and password-file lookup are intentionally not used.

  It uses Session's public topic, peer-cache, identity, and persistence
  operations. Session remains transport-neutral; relay code owns storage,
  polling, pairing, liveness, and publication bookkeeping.

  Applications register their topic root types, local-topic enumerator and
  invitation handler with Session.shared_topics. Relay publishes those roots
  without importing application code. *Polling*, by contrast, is
  driven by whatever topics actually exist in the relay storage, not by
  this session's own topic list - otherwise a peer who's never seen a given
  topic before could never learn about it this way, which would defeat the
  point of a standalone (no prior direct P2P join) relay path.

  Bookkeeping (which hash we last published/applied per topic/peer) is
  local-only sync state, kept in its own JSON file next to the session's
  own storage file - never written into S-Protocol data, since that would make it
  content needing its own sync, which defeats the purpose.

Offered API:
  RelayManager(session, config, blob_store)
  RelayManager.channel_descriptor()
    Advertises relay as a connectable channel for Core invitations, if
    configured - {"type": "relay", "descriptor_version": 1, "root": ...,
    "identity": ...}.
  RelayLogic
    relay_topic_uuids() -> list[str]
    publish_due_topics() -> list[str]
    poll_and_apply() -> list[tuple[str, str]]
    status_payload() -> dict
    channel_descriptor() -> dict | None
    mark_topics_desired(topic_uuids) -> SessionResult
      Records topic_uuids as "desired" - the consent step that lets
      poll_and_apply graft a not-yet-locally-known topic into our own tree
      list the first time it shows up in the relay, instead of merely
      caching it as an (invisible, unowned) peer perspective forever. This
      is how two peers can share a topic through an invitation even when the
      receiver has never seen it before.
    delete_topic(topic_uuid) -> SessionResult
      Storage/bookkeeping cleanup only (mailbox topic-delete endpoint) -
      never touches a peer's own already-adopted local topic, if any.
    write_presence() -> None
      Heartbeat, called once per poll tick (app_server.py's
      channel_poll_loop) regardless of whether any topic content changed -
      head.json's own "updated_at" is ambiguous between "fine, nothing to
      publish" and "stopped running," this isn't.
    peer_liveness(peer_id) -> dict
      {"state": "alive"|"stale"|"unknown", "last_seen_seconds_ago": float,
      "threshold_seconds": float, "peer_poll_interval_seconds": float}.
      Compares the peer's presence file's server-side mtime against our
      own last write_presence() mtime - both readings come from the same
      storage backend's clock, so this is skew-free between machines with
      no explicit clock offset ever computed. "stale" means no heartbeat
      within a margin over both sides' poll intervals, not a live
      reachability check (relay has no such thing) - closer to a chat
      app's "last seen" than an online/offline dot.
    known_peer_identities() -> list[str]
      Peers we've actually applied something from, per our own bookkeeping.

Used API:
  protocol.ProtocolNode, session.Session and its shared-topic registry,
  relay_storage.LocalFolderRelayStorage,
  relay_storage.SftpRelayStorage.

        from the moment they pair - raises an alarm over content that is
        already the same on both sides, and stops syncing it.

        The third line is the one that carries the design. If everything
        this client had was published, a sibling had nowhere else to start,
        so whatever it wrote was written on top of our work and taking it
        loses nothing. That is a fast-forward established from two local

        never saw, so the sibling's version descends from something older.

        flag, and that is unchanged.
